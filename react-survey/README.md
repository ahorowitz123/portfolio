# Survey Platform

This platform allows for creation and distribution of surveys, as well as analysis of survey data and hierarchical analysis over a user set. It is in its third iteration. The first iteration was developed primarily with PHP. The second was developed in AngularJS. The current one uses React for the front-end, a MySQL Database for the backend, Sequelize and GraphQL for the database API and React-Apollo to connect GraphQL to React. **This version is currently a work in progress.**

## To run:
Use 'npm run dev' from the command line.

## Database Information:
The database login information had to be changed for privacy reasons. If you would like to run this with a working database, enter the login information of the database into server/database.js.
